## Summary

I wrote this to automate exporting your connections on LinkedIn. I was asked to write this from a member of my previous startups facebook group, Recruiting Leaders.

I learned how to bypass getting detected while using Selenium and how to select elements whose classes are dynamically generated.

This code uses:

- Python 2.7
- Selenium
- LinkedIn
- Environment Variables:
  - LINKEDIN_LOGIN_EMAIL - please export before running code
  - LINKEDIN PASSWORD - please export before running code.
